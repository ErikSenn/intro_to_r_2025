# A Brief Introduction to Programming with R

This course introduces students to the fundamental practices of programming with R in the context of economic research. The course briefly covers basic theoretical concepts and teaches basic skills in how to make use of the high-level programming language and statistical computing environment R. Examples and exercises are focused on data handling and data analysis tasks. The overall aim is to give students a solid overview of basic programming in R, and how they can potentially make use of R during their studies and research in economics.
